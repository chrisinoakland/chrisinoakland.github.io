I have put on many hats in this wonderful life in the technology industry, 
beginning with troubleshooting PC hardware and software issues at that small 
computer consulting company (which went on to become one of the biggest in 
central Nebraska), on through supporting networked environments using Microsoft 
Systems Management Server and Symantec’s anti-virus products, being a Linux 
administrator, becoming an inventor and entrepreneur after getting bitten by 
the Apple bug and falling in love with iPod and Mac, which lead to teaching myself 
HTML and CSS and web design, taking me down the path of becoming the user experience 
architect for Valley Irrigation, a subsidiary of Valmont Industries.

It’s been a truly wonderful journey thus far, and I feel absolutely lucky to be 
where I am. I am humbled that this beautiful path of learning has now delivered 
me to the doorstep of data science, and well, here we are, about to cross the 
finish line of completing a master’s degree.
