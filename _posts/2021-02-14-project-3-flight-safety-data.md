## Project Proposal

### Which Domain?

_What domain is this data going to come from? Please list 10 references (with a brief annotation) to use to make sense of what you’re doing with these data._

This project will focus on the safety of airline travel and whether more recent crashes are a cause for concern for both the airline industry and the general public.

### Which Data?

_What is the dataset you’ll be examining? Please provide a codebook if there is one or a link to the dataset as well as a detailed description._

The data I’ll be working with for this project will come from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and the Aviation Safety Network.

### Research Questions? Benefits? Why Analyze these Data?

_How are you proposing to analyze this dataset? This is about your approach. Here, you’ll be proposing your research questions as well as justifications for why you’d offer these data in this way._

The genesis of this project began in previous work for this course, and I wanted to extend it by looking at additional years and see if there are any other trends to discover. For example, how did the number of airline incidents, crashes, and fatalities look during the years 2015-2020? Are there any things that stand out in this data? How did airline incidents compare to auto incidents?

### What Method?

_What methods will you be using? What will those methods provide in terms of analysis? How is this useful?_

The primary method that will be used to present the airline safety data’s story will be infographics. I wanted to key in on this method as a way to present the data to show a more well-rounded portfolio.

### Potential Issues?

_What challenges do you anticipate having? What could cause this project to go off schedule?_

Like most of the projects, my primary concern is time and being able to get everything wrapped up and presented in a way that I am happy with.

### Concluding Remarks

Flying has long been considered one of the safest ways to travel — particularly when compared to automobiles. However, because of recent unfortunate airline crashes, it is now being presented to the public as one of the most dangerous. In fact, numerous media outlets around the country have been touting statistics stating that flying is no longer a safe way of traveling. News and media outlets have bombarded the public with statistics and figures about airline safety trends, and are reporting, overall, that things do not look good for the industry. With that narrative in mind, a study was undertaken to look into historical data of airline and automobile incidents, crashes, and fatalities, and also to dig deeper into the underlying factors of the most recent airline crashes, to truly understand if what is being presented by the media is accurate.

## Project Check-In

### _Any surprises from your domain from these data?_

So far there are not too many surprises from the data that I am working with, other than the number of airline fatalities for the year 2017, which was extremely low at only 44 from 10 crashes. That is almost mind blowing when you stop to think about it! Certainly any number of fatalities are horrific, but the fact that only 44 lives were lost in airline crashes that year definitely stood out to me when looking over the data from years 2015 through 2020.

### _Is the dataset what you thought it was?_

Going into this last project, I was expecting it to be much easier to find readily available downloadable datasets for the airline fatality information for years 2015 through 2020. And while to some extent that is true — as the years 2015 through 2019 weren’t too difficult to attain from ASN (Aviation Safety Network) — I ended up doing a lot of my work manually — which seems to be a trend in my projects, unfortunately. The 2020 airline fatality data could have been scraped from the [https://aviation-safety.net/database/dblist.php?Year=2020](https://aviation-safety.net/database/dblist.php?Year=2020) page, and automation could really make all of this a lot easier if there was a lot of data to scrape; however, with just a bit more than 300 rows, it was easier and faster to copy and paste the data from the web page’s table into a spreadsheet.

### _Have you had to adjust your approach or research questions?_

Luckily, I have not had to adjust my research questions nor my approach, and this is most likely because this project is an extension or addition to one that we took on in a previous course, DSC 640 Data Presentation and Visualization. I wanted to focus in on the presentation and visualization elements for this final project, and I was very curious about how the fatality numbers looked for the most recent years after the 1985 through 2014 timeframe that were part of the 640 work.

### _Is your method working?_

Yes, my method is working with no issues, and I plan to present updated visuals and graphics representing these additional years (2015 - 2020) of this extended study. Will the trend of decreasing airline fatalities continue for this five year stretch compared to the previous years, or will there be some of an upward trend? It will be most interesting to see things charted out.

### _What challenges are you having?_

One of the biggest challenges I had was one that I touched on earlier, and that was getting compiled airline fatality and crash data for the year 2020 from Aviation Safety Network (ASN), the primary resource used for the project data. I am convinced that is only because that data is compiled and presented in the format that I was used to seeing for the other years sometime later in the year, and it just hadn’t been done yet this early in 2021 for the 2020 year. As discussed, I copied and pasted the table of individual crashes from 2020 from their website into my own spreadsheet and was able to do the summary and count functions easily.
