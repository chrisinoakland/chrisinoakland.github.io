## Project Proposal

### Which Domain?

_What domain is this data going to come from? Please list 10 references (with a brief annotation) to use to make sense of what you’re doing with these data._

This project will focus on the safety of airline travel and whether more recent crashes are a cause for concern for both the airline industry and the general public.

### Which Data?

_What is the dataset you’ll be examining? Please provide a codebook if there is one or a link to the dataset as well as a detailed description._

The data I’ll be working with for this project will come from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and the Aviation Safety Network.

### Research Questions? Benefits? Why Analyze these Data?

_How are you proposing to analyze this dataset? This is about your approach. Here, you’ll be proposing your research questions as well as justifications for why you’d offer these data in this way._

The genesis of this project began in previous work for this course, and I wanted to extend it by looking at additional years and see if there are any other trends to discover. For example, how did the number of airline incidents, crashes, and fatalities look during the years 2015-2020? Are there any things that stand out in this data? How did airline incidents compare to auto incidents?

### What Method?

_What methods will you be using? What will those methods provide in terms of analysis? How is this useful?_

The primary method that will be used to present the airline safety data’s story will be infographics. I wanted to key in on this method as a way to present the data to show a more well-rounded portfolio.

### Potential Issues?

_What challenges do you anticipate having? What could cause this project to go off schedule?_

Like most of the projects, my primary concern is time and being able to get everything wrapped up and presented in a way that I am happy with.

### Concluding Remarks

Flying has long been considered one of the safest ways to travel — particularly when compared to automobiles. However, because of recent unfortunate airline crashes, it is now being presented to the public as one of the most dangerous. In fact, numerous media outlets around the country have been touting statistics stating that flying is no longer a safe way of traveling. News and media outlets have bombarded the public with statistics and figures about airline safety trends, and are reporting, overall, that things do not look good for the industry. With that narrative in mind, a study was undertaken to look into historical data of airline and automobile incidents, crashes, and fatalities, and also to dig deeper into the underlying factors of the most recent airline crashes, to truly understand if what is being presented by the media is accurate.
